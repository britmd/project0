          <p class="aboutme"> Hi, my name is Melon. I am six years old and I'm just your average cat. I wouldn't say there's much special about me, but my person sure thinks I am pretty great - guess that's why she adopted me. Making a website about me seems to be easier than making one about herself, so here we are! You're going to learn some stuff about me, my likes, my dislikes, my preferred food - all that junk. Hopefully it'll be somewhat entertaining for you? If not, I am sure the world will be fine (well here's hoping - this COVID-19 stuff is wild).</p>
          <p>To kick things off, I want to give a little background about myself. The first three years of my life I lived in a shelter. Things were alright, I can't really complain. Other cats would come and go, but to be honest, as long as I was getting fed everyday and a couple of pats - I was really chilling.</p>
          <p>I went into a foster home maybe around 2.5 years old? The family was fun, but I was more or less stuck in a room with the kids since the dog wasn't a huge fan of me. It was better than the shelter though! I got WAY more pats and treats. After about being there for 6 months though, I was put back in a kennel and brought to the shelter. I was bummed, but that's just how things go sometimes.</p>
          <p>While I'm hanging at the shelter, this girl comes in and I dunno, I just had a good feeling about her. I got up, gave a little stretch, and put on my best show. I didn't have to work too hard! She immediately came over and within a minute of seeing me stated that I was the only cat she had eyes for. So here we are! She adopted me and we lived in New Orleans for some time. I had other cat friends and met people friends. It was nice! After a year and a half, we moved up to Boston. It's been quite the journey and excited to see how it will all unfold.</p>
