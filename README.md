 Project 0 for cs50

For this project I decided to create a website for my cat, Melon. I couldn't really think of anything else and considering I am spending so much time with him at home now, he's definitely in the front of my mind. Across all the pages you will find the navigation bar that comes from the bootstrap example template code. Also, if you adjust the screen size the background and font text changes to a different color.

Index.html Page:
On this page you will find various images of Melon. This is where I chose to demonstrate the bootstrap grid system. I also used the alert message that bootstrap has. I added the JS and jquery script at the bottom of the code so that the user can close out the alert-info message.

aboutme.html page:
This page contains information about Melon and an image of Melon. I wanted to demonstrate the css ability to curve the text around the image so I wrote an excessive amount of information about Melon to fully demonstrate that.

facts.html page:
On this page I created a list and a table. I styled them to be side by side.

contact.html page:

Here I used the form html tag and created a contact form for users to inquire about Melon.

I wrote all of my styling on style.scss and used the sass command to compile the code and make it readable - creating the style.css doc.
